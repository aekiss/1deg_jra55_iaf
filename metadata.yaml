  1 degree ACCESS-OM2 global model configuration under interannual forcing.
  The configuration is based on that described in Kiss et al. (2020),
  https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-401-2020, but with many improvements.
  Initial conditions are WOA13v2 potential temperature and practical salinity.
  Run with JRA55-do v1.4.0 interannually-varying forcing with all solid runoff
  converted to liquid runoff with no heat transfer.
  Initial condition is /scratch/v45/hh0162/access-om2/archive/1deg_jra55_iaf_omip2-fixed/restart131
  which is the 1 Jan 1968 state from cycle 3 of /scratch/v45/hh0162/access-om2/control/1deg_jra55_iaf_omip2-fixed
  but this run configuration does not use BGC, unlike the initial condition.
  NOTE: this is a perturbation experiment, but the description above is for the control run.
  This perturbation experiment is based on the control run /home/156/aek156/payu/param_ensemble/ensemble/../1deg_jra55_iaf_ensemble
  but with initial condition /scratch/jk72/aek156/access-om2/archive/1deg_jra55_iaf_ensemble/restart131
  and ice/cice_in.nml -> dynamics_nml -> cosw and sinw changed to give a turning angle of 16 degrees.
